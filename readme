# Simple Generative NFT in Solidity

This repository contains a simple example of a generative Non-Fungible Token (NFT) implemented in Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain.

## Introduction

Generative NFTs are a fascinating use case in the NFT space, allowing for the creation of unique and programmatically generated digital assets. This project serves as a starting point for understanding the basics of creating generative NFTs using Solidity.

## Code Overview

The core of this project is the Solidity smart contract: [hello Blockchain.sol](hello%20Blockchain.sol). Here's a brief overview of its functionality:

- **Contract Overview**: A high-level explanation of what the contract does.

- **Token Generation**: How the NFTs are generated programmatically.

- **Metadata**: How metadata for each NFT is handled.

- **Minting and Ownership**: Details on how tokens are minted and transferred to owners.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need:

- A development environment set up for Ethereum smart contract development.

- Basic knowledge of Solidity and Ethereum.

- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for contract deployment and testing.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to:

1. Deploy the smart contract.
2. Mint your own generative NFTs.
3. Interact with the contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
